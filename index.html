            <p class="earlier">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
                my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
                some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
                phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
                made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
                the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
